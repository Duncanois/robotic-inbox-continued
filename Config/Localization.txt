cntSecureRoboticInboxDesc,blocks,Container,"Place this Inbox in your LCB, within 5 meters of the containers you use to organize your items and resources.\n\nPlacing items within the Inbox then closing it will automatically distribute and sort them into the nearby container(s) with matching item types. Any item than cannot be matched will remain in the Inbox until you choose a container to place it in.\n\nPress & hold [action:local:Activate][action:permanent:Activate] to lock it or set a combination.\n\nThe Inbox will provide feedback by temporarily changing the text on each writeable storage chest it interacts with; these kinds of chests are recommended."

cntSecureRoboticInboxTip01,Journal Tip,,"The [00ff80]Secure Robotic Inbox[-] is a new block meant to streamline item/resource organization within a base and help you to get back into the action as quickly as possible.\n\nWhen placed [ff8000]within an LCB[-], it will automatically send all of the items it receives to nearby player-placed storage containers up to 5 meters away in any direction (so long as they're within the same LCB).\n\nFor security reasons, [ff8000]the Inbox will need to use the same password as any locked storage containers it tries to organize[-].\n\nWhile any secure or insecure player-placed storage container will work with the Inbox, [00ff80]Writable Storage Boxes will describe how the Inbox is interacting with them[-], making them the recommended type of container to place near an Inbox.\n\nAny items in the Inbox that are not able to be matched with another container will be left there until you have time to decide which container to store them in.\n\nThis new Inbox can be crafted at the Workbench or found for sale by a trader whenever you're ready"

Any items added to this Inbox will be automatically distributed to nearby containers (within 5 meters) already containing those same items.\n\nPress & hold [action:local:Activate][action:permanent:Activate] to lock it or set a combination.\n\nThe Inbox will provide feedback by temporarily changing the text on each writeable storage chest it interacts with, so these kinds of chests are recommended."

cntSecureRoboticInboxTip01,Journal Tip,,"The [00ff80]Secure Robotic Inbox[-] is a new block meant to streamline item/resource organization within a base and help you to get back into the action as quickly as possible.\n\nWhen placed [ff8000]within an LCB[-], it will automatically send all of its items to nearby player-placed storage containers up to 5 meters away in any direction (so long as they're within the same LCB).\n\nFor security reasons, [ff8000]the Inbox will need to use the same password as any locked storage containers it tries to organize[-].\n\nWhile any secure or insecure player-placed storage container will work with the Inbox, [00ff80]Writable Storage Boxes will describe how the Inbox is interacting with them[-], making them the recommended type of container to place near an Inbox.\n\nAny items in the Inbox that are not able to be matched with another container will be left there until you have time to decide which container to store them in.\n\nThis new Inbox can be crafted at the Workbench whenever you're ready."

cntSecureRoboticInboxTip02,Journal Tip,,"The [00ff80]Secure Robotic Inbox[-] has certain requirements depending on the state of the containers it interacts with.\n\n[!] While any type of secure or insecure player container is supported, [00ff80]Writable Storage Boxes will describe how the Inbox is interacting with them[-], making them the recommended type of container to place near an Inbox.\n\nIf these requirements aren't met, the Inbox will have to skip interactions with the target container until they are addressed:\n1. containers not placed by players (ex: POI containers) are ignored.\n2. player backpacks and vehicles are ignored.\n3. both Inbox and target container must be within the same LCB.\n4. target container must be within 5 meters of Inbox.\n6. if target container is not lockable or is currently unlocked, Inbox has no requirements.\n7. if target container is locked, Inbox must be lockable, in a locked state, and set to the same password as target container."

cntSecureRoboticInboxDesc,blocks,Container,"Place this Inbox in your LCB, [00ff80]within 5 meters[-] of the containers you use to organize your items and resources. This range operates very similarly to how an LCB's range works, [00ff80]but also limits above/below checks[-] to being within 5 meters of the inbox.\n\nWhen the Inbox is closed, it will automatically distribute and sort its items into nearby container(s) with matching item types (so long as those containers are also within the same LCB area). Any item than cannot be matched will remain in the Inbox until you choose a container to place it in.\n\nPress & hold [action:local:Activate][action:permanent:Activate] to lock it or set a combination.\n\n[007fff]For more important tips on Robotic Inboxes, please reference your [00ff80]Journal[-]."

cntSecureRoboticInboxTip01,Journal Tip,,"The [00ff80]Secure Robotic Inbox[-] is a new block meant to streamline item/resource organization [ff8000]within an active LCB area[-] to help you dump your loot quickly and get back into the action. When the Inbox is closed, it will automatically distribute and sort its items into nearby container(s) with matching item types (so long as those containers are also within the same LCB area).\n\nFor security reasons, [ff8000]the Inbox will need to use the same password as any locked storage containers it tries to organize[-].\n\nWhile any secure or insecure player-placed storage container will work with the Inbox, [00ff80]Writable Storage Boxes will describe how the Inbox is interacting with them[-], making them the recommended type of container to place near an Inbox.\n\nAny items in the Inbox that are not able to be matched with another container will be left there until you have time to decide which container to store them in.\n\nThis new Inbox can be crafted at the Workbench or found for sale by a trader whenever you're ready to try it out."

cntSecureRoboticInboxTip02,Journal Tip,,"The [00ff80]Secure Robotic Inbox[-] has certain requirements depending on the state of the containers it interacts with.\n\nIf the following requirements aren't met, the Inbox will have to skip interactions with the target containers until the necessary adjustments are made:\n1. containers not placed by players (ex: POI containers) are ignored.\n2. player backpacks and vehicles are ignored.\n3. both Inbox and target container must be within the same LCB area.\n4. target container must be within 5 meters of Inbox, both horizontally and vertically (imagine a cube 11x11 in size with the inbox at the center).\n5. if target container is locked, Inbox must also be lockable, in a locked state, and set to the same password as target container.\n\n[!] Using [00ff80]Writable Storage Boxes[-] will make configuring your storage area far easier. A short explanation for why a container could not be accessed is provided for a few seconds on each writable container the Inbox is unable to access."

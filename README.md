## Summary

A special container that automatically sorts and distributes items to other nearby storage containers.

## Performance Considerations

As you might imagine, interacting instantly with multiple containers, sorting them, and distributing items to them could all be very taxing on the system.

But your performance should be stellar - here are some things to consider and some things this mod intentionally does to keep game servers running smoothly:

1. Container data is already processed server-side in 7 days to die. This means that adjustments to storage are *most* performant on the server's end rather than on the client's end and this approach actually reduces networking calls vs players organizing/stacking items themselves.
2. Container organization is run on each box within range via a *concurrent* loop. This ensures that as inboxes are working through your players' containers, the server can still process other tasks and avoid lagging.

## Auto-Sorting

> üìù Players will find this information in their journals under `Robotic Inbox (General Info) [MOD]`

The `Secure Robotic Inbox` is a new block meant to streamline item/resource organization within a base and help you to get back into the action as quickly as possible.

When placed **within an LCB**, it will automatically send all of the items it receives to nearby player-placed storage containers up to 5 meters away in any direction (so long as they're within the same LCB).

For security reasons, **the Inbox will need to use the same password as any locked storage containers it tries to organize**.

‚ö†Ô∏è While any secure or insecure player-placed storage container will work with the Inbox, **Writable Storage Boxes will describe how the Inbox is interacting with them**, making them the recommended type of container to place near an Inbox.

Any items in the Inbox that are not able to be matched with another container will be left there until you have time to decide which container to store them in.

This new Inbox can be crafted at the Workbench or found for sale by a trader whenever you're ready.

## Placement/Configuration Requirements

> üìù Players will find this information in their journals under `Robotic Inbox (Security Info) [MOD]`

The `Secure Robotic Inbox` has certain requirements depending on the state of the containers it interacts with.

‚ö†Ô∏è Using `Writable Storage Boxes` will make configuring your storage area far easier, thanks to the feedback text that will appear when the Inbox attempts to interact with them.

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è In versions prior to 1.3.0, the original text on Writable Storage Boxes could be permanently lost if the temporary text was showing while the last remaining player in the area logged out or the server restarted. As of version 1.3.0 and beyond, this is no longer an issue.

If the following requirements aren't met, the Inbox will have to skip interactions with the target containers until the necessary adjustments are made:

1. containers not placed by players (ex: POI containers) are ignored.
2. player backpacks and vehicles are ignored.
3. both Inbox and target container must be within the same LCB area.
4. target container must be within 5 meters of Inbox, both horizontally and vertically (imagine a cube 11x11 in size with the inbox at the center).
5. if target container is locked, Inbox must also be lockable, in a locked state, and set to the same password as target container.

## Compatibility

- Server-side mod only: client does not need to download anything, but this is not expected to work in single-player or locally hosted games
